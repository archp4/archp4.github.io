          Welcome to my portfolio website! I am a dedicated and passionate
          individual with a solid foundation in Information Technology. My
          journey in IT began with a Diploma from Bhailalbhai and Bhikhabhai
          Institute of Technology, where I gained valuable insights into the
          fundamentals of technology and its applications. Building upon this
          foundation, I pursued a Bachelor's degree at Devang Patel Institute of
          Advanced Technology and Research (CHARUSAT University), where I delved
          deeper into various aspects of IT, honing my skills and expanding my
          knowledge base.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify md:text-left text-sm mb-2">
          During my academic journey, I embarked on a hands-on learning
          experience as an App Developer intern at Mitra Fintech, a dynamic
          startup. Over the course of 4-5 months, I collaborated with a talented
          team, contributing to the development of innovative mobile
          applications. This internship not only provided me with practical
          experience but also enhanced my problem-solving abilities and teamwork
          skills.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify md:text-left text-sm mb-2">
          Currently, I am furthering my education at Humber College, pursuing a
          post-secondary certificate program in Information Technology
          Solutions. This program is equipping me with advanced technical
          expertise and industry-relevant skills, preparing me to thrive in the
          ever-evolving field of technology.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify md:text-left text-sm mb-2">
          In addition to my academic pursuits, I am actively seeking part-time
          opportunities to apply my knowledge and skills in real-world settings.
          I am eager to explore new challenges and contribute to innovative
          projects while continuing my academic journey. With a strong
          educational background, practical experience, and a passion for
          technology, I am committed to making a meaningful impact in the IT
          industry.
